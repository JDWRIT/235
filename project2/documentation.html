<h1>Hello and welcome</h1>
<h3>This is my (Joshua DeWinter) documentation for IGME 235s Project 2 on Web API use</h3>
<br>
<h2>Proposal</h2>
<p>Created the webpage and implemented a function to grab information from the API I am using.</p>
<br>
<h2>Prototype</h2>
<p>Added input fields to the webpage and made custom searching based upon these inputs available.
    Most if not all of the basic/core functionality for the project has been implemented at this point,
    the only things that are left to do are specific project requirements and ease-of-use additions.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Peer Feedback</h2>
<p>I added some peer feedback, and here where the things I gathered would be good to implement:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Allow for uppercase letters in the pokemon search bar</li>
    <li>Reduce the max width of the pokemon results</li>
    <li>Have a better description of how to use the site/make it more intuitive</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these primary things, other tweaks that would be nice that arent explicitly labeled in the project requirements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Only allow for numbers to be typed in the "number of results" field</li>
    <li>Space out the UI elements more</li>
    <li>Find a font that better suits the site</li>
    <li>Have a hotkey such as "enter" submit the API request so you don't need to press the "search" button</li>
</ul>
<p>That seems to be a good set of things for me to work on, in addition to the few things required for the project itself</p>
