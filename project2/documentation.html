<h1>Hello and welcome</h1>
<h3>This is my (Joshua DeWinter) documentation for IGME 235s Project 2 on Web API use</h3>
<br>
<h2>Proposal</h2>
<p>Created the webpage and implemented a function to grab information from the API I am using.</p>
<br>
<h2>Prototype</h2>
<p>Added input fields to the webpage and made custom searching based upon these inputs available.
    Most if not all of the basic/core functionality for the project has been implemented at this point,
    the only things that are left to do are specific project requirements and ease-of-use additions.
