        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>Hello there! My name is Joshua DeWinter and I am a 2nd year <abbr title="Interactive Games and Media">IGME</abbr> student at <abbr title="Rochester Institute of Technology">RIT</abbr>.
        I joined the game development program to continue exploring my love of game and experience creation. I hope continually further my understanding of game development everyday at RIT and prepare myself for all the challenges game production may throw my way in the future.
        My medium of choice is <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr> and I have made a game for the Meta Quest 2, however my current knowledge of the game production process does apply to other platforms such as flatscreen and console.</p>
